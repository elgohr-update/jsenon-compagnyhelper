# Compagny helper

Tired to find into your bookmarks a corporate link?

Why do not use a helper command line in order to retrieve for example the compagny kibana urls?

## WIP

## How its work

A client cli will contact a server containing all the corporate usefull links

## Example

```sh
compagnyhelper get links
```

```sh
conpagnyhelper describe links kibana
```

```sh
compagnyhelper open links kibana
```
